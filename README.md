# GUI Apps

This repository contains python scripts for applications with a graphical user interface (GUI).  Although the example screenshots of the applications were taken on a Mac, Windows or Linux could also run the scripts unless otherwise noted.

## Prerequisites

Remember to check if you have the proper python modules installed before running each script.  Python 3.6 or later must also be used.
