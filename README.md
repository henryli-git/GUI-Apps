# GUI Apps

This repository contains python scripts for applications with a graphical user interface (GUI).  Although the example screenshots of the apps were taken on either a Mac or Windows, the apps could run on different operating systems unless otherwise noted.  The GUI may also appear differently on different operating systems.

## Prerequisites

Remember to check if you have the proper python modules installed before running each script.
