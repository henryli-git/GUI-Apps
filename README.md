# GUI Apps

This repository contains python scripts for applications with a graphical user interface (GUI). Although the example screenshots of the applications were taken on either a Mac or Windows, the applications could run on different operating systems unless otherwise noted. The GUI may also appear differently on different operating systems.

## Prerequisites

Remember to check if you have the proper python modules installed if you are running directly from the script rather than the executable.
